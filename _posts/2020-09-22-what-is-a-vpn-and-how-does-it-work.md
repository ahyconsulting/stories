### What does a VPN stand for?

VPN is Virtual Private Network. It is an online privacy tool to make the internet safer, more secure, and more private.

A Virtual Private Network is a connection method used to add security and privacy to private and public networks.  For instance, like WiFi Hotspots and the Internet. Corporations use Virtual Private Networks to protect sensitive data.  

### How does a VPN work?

Data is transmitted from your client machine to a point in your Virtual Private Network. The Virtual Private Network point encrypts your data and sends it through the internet. Another point in your VPN network encrypts your data and sends it to the appropriate internet resource, such as a web server, an email server, or your company's intranet. Then the internet resource sends data back to a point in your Virtual Private Network, where it gets encrypted. That encrypted data is sent through the internet to another point in your Virtual Private Network, which decrypts the data and sends it back to your client machine.

### What are the Benefits of Using a Virtual Private Network?

* Enhanced security.
When you connect to the network through a Virtual Private Network, the data is kept secure and encrypted. In this way, the information is away from the hackers’ eyes.

2. Remote control.
In the case of a company, the great advantage of having a Virtual Private Network is that the information can be accessed remotely even from home or from any other place. That’s why a Virtual Private Network can increase productivity within a company.

3. Share files.
A Virtual Private Network service can be used if you have a group that needs to share data for an extended period.

4. Online anonymity.
Through a Virtual Private Network you can browse the web in complete anonymity. Compared to hiding IP software or web proxies, the advantage of a Virtual Private Network  service is that it allows you to access both web applications and websites in complete anonymity.



5. Unblock websites & bypass filters.
Virtual Private Networks are great for accessing blocked websites or for bypassing Internet filters. This is why there is an increased number of VPN services used in countries where Internet censorship is applied.

6. Change the IP address. 
If you need an IP address from another country, then a Virtual Private Network can provide you this.


7. Users are able to download safely and anonymously. 
Because the IP address is hidden and the connection is encrypted, third parties will no longer be able to figure out what exactly is being downloaded or by whom. Because of the encrypted Virtual Private Network tunnel, they cannot register what is being downloaded through the secure Virtual Private Network connection. When you’re downloading sensitive and/or important files (say for work), nobody can intercept and view this information. Privacy and anonymity are guaranteed, or at the very least greatly improved.
