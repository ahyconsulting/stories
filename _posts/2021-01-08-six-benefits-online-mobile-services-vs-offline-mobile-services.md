The debate between the offline and online market continues in almost all areas.  The online market has caught up because it is more convenient and accessible regardless of time, place, and experience.  Offline sources consist of the old traditional methods of physical markets and storage space.  However, both types of online and offline market sources have their pros and cons, and people prefer them according to their preferences and comfort levels. 
  
More people with options available would prefer to choose online sources because of the benefits listed below. 

### Time savior

When shopping or browsing online, you can save a lot of time as everything is literally under the control of your fingers.  Also, many people who are at work or some important event can do it from their location and save time. 

### No need for unnecessary transportation

Traveling from one place to another just to sell your phone would be really pointless as you are traveling from one store to another costing you so much.  Online sources help you save on that cost that you spend on the travel part.  Also, better to be disappointed with the prices offered there and go shopping, people prefer to sit at home and do it right away. 
No time barriers

You can have a look or shop anywhere and anytime, unlike traditional sources as there are time barriers or restrictions there.  Online resources lead you to a better place when it comes to time and factor. 

### Better prices

This is yet another factor that counts on the main benefits of online sources.  Offline stores are sure to hold back when it comes to the price factor.  Online sources offer you the best possible price while saving on additional costs. 

### Avoiding crowd

Taking into account the current situation in times of Covid 19, it is important to follow all necessary hygiene measures and precautions against the virus.  So crowd avoidance is the new trend, so it already gives us the solution for the online market. 

### Easy to browse

One can easily type and search whatever specific they are looking for in the online market unlike hunting for your requirement in the offline sources.
Coming towards a conclusion we can only come to the analysis that even after one person has different choices of sources like they prefer it according to their comfort.
