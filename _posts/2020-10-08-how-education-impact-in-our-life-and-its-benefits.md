The first thing that strikes us in the mind what education is, "Education is to acquire knowledge on any particular subject." Education is a tool that provides knowledge, skill, technique, information, and much more.  Develops capacities to fight good and evil and provides an understanding of right and wrong.  It gives us knowledge of the world.  Without education, you cannot explore new ideas.  In the current situation without education, nobody can live in this world.  At this time the main problem for parents is to get the best education for their children because education is a fundamental part of life.  If parents are looking for the best boarding school in Delhi, then they have a great choice, but which is the best school for the best education, is the main confusion.

### Importance of Education in Our Society-

Education is important because it plays a big role in modern, industrialized society. People need a good education to be able to survive in this world.  In modern society is based on high living standards so you and your kids need to educate. If you are educated then you can be safe and secure from Cyber Crime.

Education provides an understanding of women's empowerment.  It also helps in some other cases such as remarriage of widows, Sati Prata, child marriage, dowry system, and much more.  It brings a lot of development in the community as well as in the nation.  If you are educated then you can understand your rights and you can talk.  Education gives us the right to freedom of expression. 

### Education Helps in the creation of a better society.

Education is the backbone of our society.  Lack of education creates problems such as poor health, superstition, domestic violence, and poor living standards.  Education is not for the separate community, everyone has the authority to learn.  It provides equal opportunities for both men and women, so it is not separate for the community.  If we talk about education then without a good education, a better society cannot be formed. 

It helps people to find the best solution to their problems.  Education realizes the human being what the real value of the contribution is.  It is the most powerful weapon that no one can steal and snatch from you.  It enables people to read and write the information as most of the information is transferred from one person to another by writing and is a good method of communication.  If you want to raise your children, choose the best school and teacher for your children because a good teacher can teach your children good things.  In our society the teacher's definition is great, a teacher is greater than God because he tells you who God is.  If you are looking for the best boarding school for your child, choose schools with experienced and trained teachers.  The school, which has additional curriculum activities in addition to your daily study, is best suited for your child's growth and physical development.  This is how you raise your children.  Our job is to educate all of society, not just part of society.  We have to enable them to increase their potential.
