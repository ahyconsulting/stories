Students are not capable of taking enough pressure until they learn to cope up with the situations that seem difficult to them. They also have to face many other new challenges like settling with a roommate, managing the workload, enhance your own identity, and so on. It is noticed, many of the students don’t make things hard for them, as they’re smart enough to find out the way. 

However, if you are feeling low or stressed enough and don't know how to handle this pressure on you, it can lead to severe mental illness.  First, try to fix things yourself, but if you can't, get help.  It can save you from a negative impact on your academic career and performance.

Here we have listed some signs you might have when you are stressed: Many signs can be noticed, but these are the basic ones:

- Feeling irritated by the things you were asked to do.
- Feel anxious and fearful of whatever you do.  
- Don't enjoy the things that were once your bundle of joy.  
- Think negatively of everything.  
- Feel lonely even in a crowded room.  
- Create a panic situation for no reason. 

### Due to severity:

- You may have trouble sleeping or severe insomnia.  
- You may experience eating problems: 
- Eat a lot or not eat at all, and you may start to bite your nails or grind your teeth without conscious control.  
- You start shivering at any time of the day or night.  
- You hold people back for no reason, you feel short of breath, and a fast heartbeat. 

To cope with academic stress, here are some good ways for students, which are very helpful for them, let's go through the list to read them: 
 
### Find something creative to do:

It is said that playing with colors can help you reduce stress or things that you love, such as painting, sculpting, and designing.  Some people love to cook and wash their clothes, while others like to read a book with a cup of coffee in their beds.  To relieve stress, give yourself some time to do what you want.  It's scientifically proven;  Washing dishes can help relieve stress.  If you're feeling stressed, why not try it?  Not only doing dishes but also spending time with yourself or loved ones can make you feel less stressed, so you can sleep well at night.  Be your kind of beauty and trust yourself;  They want things that you do.

### Drink plenty of water and eat well:

Is water really useful?  Yes, it is very helpful!  When you drink a lot of water, your body can feel enough strength to help you cope with stress.  Not only does drinking plenty of water help you reduce stress, but eating right can also help.  It is said that if you are feeling stressed, try eating some chocolates or something sweet so it can help you feel less stressed.  

How Sweet Can You Reduce Stress?  Well, it's a good question, candy releases endorphin, which is our happy hormone.  When it is released, we begin to feel relaxed and happy as long as it remains in our blood.  So, try something sugary, when things get on your nerves.

### Do exercise daily:

It's another way of treating yourself so well;  daily exercise can help reduce stress and make you feel beautiful and strong every day.  With each passing day as we get older, we know how the bones are going to be affected when there is no more vitamin D in our body, so why not get some sun at 8 am.  If you want to break free from a stressful cage, wake up early in the morning and start walking with your friend or a favourite friend.  It will not only help you reduce your stress, but also keep you healthy enough to feel empowered for every hard job you do.

### Get enough sleep:

Why is your sleep pattern disturbed?  Being a college student, you should sleep early to get up early in the morning.  Avoid distractions by turning off your phone or internet if you can't do both, then turn off notifications for a peaceful sleep.  To keep your brain away from mental illness, you need to know the value of sleeping for at least 7-8 hours a day.  If just in case, you're not sleeping well, you may end up having problems with memorizing things and other mental disorders so why are you hurting yourself when you know the pros and cons.  Don't just do it with yourself, or you will end up losing yourself.
