Consumers make decisions based on web design every day, and often those decisions are intuitive.  Sometimes it's not obvious if a particular web design works better than another until you see which one is making the money.  Many business owners are skilled enough to put together a decent looking website, but often these just aren't against professional web design.  The right web design requires special skills and talents - just like any other form of direct marketing.  Like a television commercial or poster, your web design should be suitable for anyone who comes across it.

In today's world, your web design is often the first impression that people find on your business, so your web design should reflect your own corporate identity.  Don't just imitate your competitors' web design!  A skilled web designer can identify the successful attributes of another website and incorporate them into their web design, without simply copying it.  Companies that specialize in web design and website development will work with you to ensure that your final web design represents your business in the right way.  This includes the layout of your graphics, the overall design, your logo, and even the style of your content.  Investing in a professional digital agency can mean the difference between a web design that fails or one that works for you in the long run. 

When you are satisfied with web design, you can start moving towards web development.  Digital agencies usually handle most of this for you, however it's important to let them know exactly how you think your website works.  The way your website works should maximize the integrity and transparency of your business.  A consumer wants to hear that they understand how they are interacting with your online business, and any small oversight could precipitate your consumer sentiment.  Your website should also do things slightly differently from your competitors, but not too differently to alienate your new customers.  It's a fine line that professional web developers get over and over again. 

The next thing your website needs to do for your business is bring in leads.  It does this with the right marketing strategy.  Search Engine Marketing (SEM) is a big industry these days and for good reason.  Every business wants their website to appear at the top of someone's online searches.  Good digital agencies offer you the complete package of web design, construction and development as well as website marketing and search engine optimization (SEO).  There are many different techniques that can be used to generate traffic to your website and move it up the search ranks.  These can take the form of link building, advertising, pay-per-click advertising (PPC) or social networks.

SEM and SEO are crucial to attracting potential clients and clients, however, it is important not to discount the roles of web design and web development.  All three work together.  It doesn't make sense for your website to appear on page one of Google if people just close it when they see your web design.  People judge by looks, and if your website doesn't look good, your business is probably not worth it.  Making the right decisions in your online marketing campaigns will save you time and earn you money in the long run;  that's why it's smart to invest in proper web design and administration.
