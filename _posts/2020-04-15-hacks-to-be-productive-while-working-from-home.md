COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of things, including our perspective of what's normal. This might be the beginning of a new normal for all of us. With every state and country enforcing lockdown to curb the spread of this outbreak, many businesses have invoked and enabled working from home for their workforce, wherever they can.

But working from home is not easy. Find out <a href="https://stories.ahyconsulting.com/why-is-working-fromo-home-so-hard/" target="\_blank"> why working from home is so exhausting </a> in this blog post.

Following are 5 simple hacks, that you can implement right away to boost your productivity while working from home.

### 01. Private Space

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/privatespacewfh.jpg" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

Do not work where you sleep. I repeat again, DO NOT WORK WHERE YOU SLEEP. Our mind works in mysterious ways. Our brain correlate experiences. A gym is for working out, office space is for working and bedroom is for sleeping. Now try to interchange this, you are going to have hard time adjusting.

Create a private space dedicated for working. This does not have to be a large home office room. It can be a small corner space, with enough natural light and away from your bed.

If you continue to work in the same space where you sleep, soon enough the brain will associate the place with being focussed and actively working. And once that happens, you will find difficulties to get a good night sleep.


### 02. Posture

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/sitstraightwfh.jpg" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

Straight back, sit upright and computer screen straight in front of you. This simple manoeuvre is going to make you less tired by the end of the day. You will feel less worn out.


### 03. Prioritise, Schedule & Start Early

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/todowfh.jpg" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

The first thing before you start your work is to prioritise and set a target of your day's accomplishments. The first 2 hours of the day is most critical and you will get the most productivity out during these hours. Go wired in and go gung-ho.

Starting early will give you an additional motivational boost when you accomplish tasks with an entire day still available to you.


### 04. Take planned breaks.

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/takebreakwfh.jpg" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

Do not work continuously for over 2 hours without any break. Take a small 5 min break, stand up, walk around, go to the window, watch the blue sky and birds flying, drink water, stretch and get back for another power-packed session. A small trick that I follow is to say "5...4...3...2...1...GO" in your mind before getting to work after a break.


### 05. Avoid Overworking. Define work hours.

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/finishworkwfh.jpg" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

Knowing that you will have to end your work day at a fixed time will make you more focussed and driven to finish your work faster. When we stretch our work hours, we subconsciously get more relaxed. We get a feeling (or rather an illusion) that we got a lot of time. We lose the drive to get the work done faster.
