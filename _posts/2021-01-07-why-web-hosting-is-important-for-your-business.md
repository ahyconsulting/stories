Uptime is probably one of the most important aspects that every business owner should check before making a decision.  Since customers can visit your website at any time, your website must be active at all times.  Since servers are maintained from time to time, this leads to downtime for your website.  If these are scheduled and you are informed, this is pretty normal.  However, if your website experiences unplanned downtime very frequently, it should probably be better to consider switching your hosting provider.  Another thing you might consider is VPS instead of shared hosting plans.  Yes, shares are cheaper, but doing some special promotions and at the same time getting other websites on your server unusually high will reduce the bandwidth of your website and can even crash the server. 

Most professional hosting companies offer scalable hosting options.  This is also very important because as your site grows you will need a host that can scale with you.  You may have started with a shared plan and then a VPS, or even a dedicated server is needed to meet your business needs. 

Another important aspect when running an online business is website security features.  Especially if it is an eCommerce site where people create their accounts with payment details or personal information.  Shared hosting plans are not advisable in this case as in most cases they have less security features and if another site on the same server is attacked your site can also be compromised resulting in a loss.  data and even privacy breaches.  If you want the maximum amount of security features, it should be a good idea to choose at least one VPS package and one hosting provider that might not be the cheapest but prioritize security features. 

It doesn't matter if you are just starting out with your online store or if you have a well-known brand, customer service is always important.  A good hosting provider does not provide you with servers but most importantly, it has extensive experience and quick answers to hosting issues.  Sometimes it is not easy to find good and friendly customer service among even the most well-known companies.  So, if you are not satisfied with the support, this is a good reason to change your provider and find the best one.  Some of the best companies offer customer support via phone, email, or chat 24/7.
