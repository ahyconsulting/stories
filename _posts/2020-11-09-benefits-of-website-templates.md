### Website Templates

For many people, it makes more sense to use a pre-designed web template than building a site from scratch.  Using a pre-designed website template allows you to get a professional design at a fraction of the price a custom design would cost. A good template is automatic or includes HTML tags to show you exactly where to place the text.  This saves you valuable time. Also, a web page designed by someone learning HTML is likely to contain more errors than those designed and tested by professionals. Errors in website code could prevent some users from being able to see the webpage or they could lower search engine rankings.

There are millions of websites on the Internet and new ones spring up every second.  While there may be more than one website using the chosen default site template, the likelihood of a visitor viewing both sites is not great.  Each site is unique in the data it presents. Web templates present data quickly and professionally without the hassle of designing anything. 

With many web templates costing less than $ 50 and many custom website designs costing well over $ 5000, it's easy to see how web templates can save you money and time.  Web templates are a great way to learn HTML. If you become familiar with professionally written code, a webmaster can pick up things on the go.  Instead of having an amateur website to start with, a newbie to HTML can have a professional website to start with a pre-built website template.

Search engines also influence the choice of web templates. Sites with HTML errors do not perform well in search engines. Particularly in earlier versions of Netscape, forgetting a "table" tag may mean that the entire page will not be displayed. A good web template has been designed and tested in many environments, according to W3C standards, for maximum compatibility. Instead of fighting your way through mistakes, take advantage of competent template designs.
