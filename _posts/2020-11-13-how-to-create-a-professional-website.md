Website design may not seem like the easiest task, but with the help of some of the new web building conveniences that have entered the market in the last few years, it is possible to create a professional website for your business with only a small investment of your time and money.  In fact, with the emergence of more options in web design like ready-made website templates, logos, and other company necessities, you can create a website in three easy steps.
 
### Step One: Plan Ahead

Before you delve into the world of web design and start looking for a suitable template, it's important to plan ahead.  You need to clearly define your business goals in advance so that the design selection process goes faster and you choose the right model.  For example, what is your target audience? You need to know your customer inside and out to choose the best site design to bring business. For example, if the majority of your business comes from companies and professionals, you will need to choose a model that suits that group of people, that gives the right first impression and demonstrates that you are a serious company that can handle top-notch customers.  .  

In this case, a simple and efficient design will be your main preference.  If, however, you're building an e-commerce site that sells a range of products, a template that can be customized for online shopping will likely be your favorite design. Maybe you need a more "flashy" website?  Flash templates are also an option and fit many different types of websites that rely on more than just text and a logo to make money.

Make sure that the template you may purchase is easy to customize and update. That's the whole point of buying a template - to make both website building and maintenance hassle-free, affordable, and fast.  You'll need to add your own content to the template and work with the overall theme once it's downloaded. Also, most businesses want to add new content, website updates, links, and so on overtime. So keep that in mind when looking for the perfect template.  If you plan to add interactive features like forums and chat areas to your websites, the template you choose should be able to do so too.
 
### Step Two: Choose a Template

Now that you are prepared, you can start shopping for a website template that works best for your business.  Start by researching the many website template companies on the market that offer professional designs at reasonable prices. Most companies also offer a choice between copyrighted and non-copyrighted material, so if you want to be the only one using the template design, spend a little more money to receive exclusive use. Once you purchase a copyrighted template, it is taken off the market.  If you can't find a template that precisely fits your business, find out which companies offer to design custom templates for your use. When you find the right template after reviewing the available designs, the rest is simple. All you have to do is purchase the template and download it to your hard drive in seconds. 
 
### Step Three: Customize

With the ready-made template, all you need to do is add your own content, graphics, images - whatever you need to personalize the site.  If you can use a simple editor like DreamWeaver or FrontPage, it can be done in a few days or less.  If you are experienced in any aspect of web design, you can hire someone to do the editing for you for a very small fee - much less than what you would pay a designer to create the entire site from zero. 

When adding content, if you only require a few simple words, consider writing the text yourself.  If you need a lot of information, such as product descriptions, articles, or sales content, consider hiring a writer to create unique and high-quality content. Since you saved tons of money on purchasing a ready-made website template, you can spend more on hiring a great writer!  If you wrote the material yourself, remember to keep it short.  Keep the paragraphs short and don't overwhelm the reader with unnecessary information.  People are in a hurry and do not want to spend much time reading pages and writing pages. Let your visitors have the information they need so they can go ahead and purchase your product or service, but also make sure that the information you provide is really useful and written without grammatical or spelling errors.

The overall design should be kept simple, but that doesn't mean you can't add graphics, images, or even videos. As long as you keep it simple, visitors won't regret visiting your site and learning more about your business. Not everyone has high-speed internet yet, so fast page loading is still a consideration. Other additions include tables, forms, and quizzes.
Tables in particular are an easy way to organize text on a web page and load very quickly.  Most HTML editors make it easy to generate tables on your website. Website templates have brought web design from its infancy and into the 21st century, meeting the unique needs of an online business owner, so not having fear of taking advantage of the convenience: you will not regret the decision.
