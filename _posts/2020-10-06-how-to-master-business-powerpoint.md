Powerpoint is used in various industries, sectors, companies, and institutions. This tool has established itself as an essential part of every meeting. Business Powerpoint presentations can be used in many ways. However, presentations created inefficiently or without appropriate formats can lead to errors.  

This software is used by many professionals. Many find it difficult to give their business presentation in PowerPoint a professional perspective. It can be very difficult to make a good impression, make sales, get leads, or even share your thoughts without having a professional presentation. Here are a few tips to help you master Business PowerPoint. 

### 1. Less is more

It can be extremely tempting to fill your business PowerPoint presentation with all the minute details.  However, your audience might appreciate it if you reduce the number of slides and content.  Presentations look much more professional if they have less clutter, less text, and simply communicate the main idea.  

### 2. Be original

While it might be easier to copy someone else's PowerPoint presentation, it can be extremely problematic for the audience. They will see right through you. Try to put in original content and avoid duplicating someone else's ideas or presentations. 
 
### 3. Be consistent

Consistency is key, especially when you want to make a good impression. Use consistent colors, fonts, screens, and contrast to highlight your graphics and text. Make sure you use a different logo than yours. This makes the logo stand out and memorable. 

### 4. Use images and video content

Text on its own can be boring to keep up with. Ensure that your presentation stands out by including some relevant video clips, animated graphics, and interesting images. The audience will only stay interested if they have something unique in the presentation. Also, images stay with people much longer than texts.

### 5. Donâ€™t use clip art 

The clip art consists of pre-made images that are used for illustrations. While clip art was popular early on, it is extremely unprofessional in this day and age. Make sure your presentation doesn't contain clip art images. Use high-quality original images. 

### 6. Use your own images

It can be difficult to find good photos for your presentation, but there is nothing worse than using free stock images.  Use photos from your phone, camera, or laptop, or buy some good images because they add so much more value than stock images. 

### 7. Limit transitions and builds

Try not to fill your presentations with animated slides, bullets, and other cliched icons.  Try to be subtle and minimalist. 

### 8. Use simple charts

The nice thing about data is that it can be very simple or extremely complex.  It is recommended that your presentation not be loaded with too much data and hard-to-read graphs.  Your audience will like infographics that are easy to read. 

### 9. Talk freely

Try to speak freely when presenting the presentation.  Try not to read directly.  This can be embarrassing and unprofessional.  Use keywords, notes, and be informative - these tips can help you make professional PowerPoint presentations.
