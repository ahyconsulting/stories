### Great Content

The copy on your website must be substantial, well written, and complete. The content of your site will be read not only by potential customers but also by Internet search engines and must clearly articulate what you offer. It must contain keywords and terms related to your business, but these must not be "inserted" into the text in such a way as to be artificially read. 

You may be able to think of sentences you read on websites where the words seemed to be in a strange order, or where a similar sentence was repeated over and over. You need to avoid this in order for the text on your website to be read naturally. This makes it easier for your potential customers to read, but it also makes it easier for the increasingly intelligent bots to crawl your website and choose where to position it on search engine results pages.

When writing the copy for your website, it is good to imagine that you are speaking directly to a potential customer. You want to clearly convey that you know what you are talking about, but not in such a way that it is full of jargon or false claims. To get it right, you will have to think about your target market and the people you want to reach, in order to speak their language. 

### Strong Images

Website design trends change over time and it's not always easy to maintain this sophisticated look. However, the use of powerful images is imperative whatever the design of your site, however, these images are presented.

Ideally, the images on your site should be a mix of photographs showing the subject material, people's photos, and then any other appropriate images. In my case, the material in question would be computers in various states of repair or deterioration. In your case, it will be what best illustrates your company's business.

The most striking photos are often those of individuals. When choosing the groups of people to display, you also need to think about your target audience. When choosing your employees' photos, consider the emotions you want their faces to convey and how that affects the overall message you want to convey across each section of your website.

### The Personal Touch

Have you ever found yourself searching for a service, comparing different websites, and wanting to know more about the company or person that would potentially provide this service to you?  Many websites say very little about the people who actually make up the business. However, the personal touch can be a game-changer, especially if the customer is looking for a service that involves someone entering their home. 

You should include biographical snapshots of your staff as they create a more personal connection with the customer. Customer retention is also key to your growth and the more personal the contact, the more likely you are to retain customers in the future.

### Credibility

It is important to communicate that you can accomplish what the customer requires.  However, self-congratulation, coupled with unfounded claims and promises, is not the way to go. Much better is to let your customers speak for you, so it's important to include customer testimonials on your website. You can start collecting these testimonials from previous clients by creating a survey for them to complete the subsequent completion of your first job for them. 

It's a good idea to have previous customers' words prominently on your home page, landing pages, and on a dedicated testimonials page. Of course, you can always be accused of creating false testimonials. The best way to counter this allegation is to use verbatim quotes from different customers, even if those quotes contain grammatical and spelling errors.  However, I would use testimonials that are free of such errors on your homepage and landing pages.

Even better is collecting their testimonials on an independent review site, which is above all accusation. One downside to doing it this way is that you may not want potential customers to click on an external site, as they can get distracted there and not return to your site. 

As a professional and trusted business, your website should also include some sort of privacy policy, website terms of use, and business terms. It should also contain your business registration details. 

### Clear Calls to Action 

There is no point in having a beautiful website with great content if you don't explain to potential customers what you want them to do as a result of their visit to your site.  This may seem obvious to you but it is important to provide a clear path for the client.  You have to visualize how to expect a potential customer to navigate your site.  Whether they stay on the landing page where they started, or navigate different pages, they should be constantly provided with calls to action.  These can be in the form of clickable buttons with words like Call Now, Book Now, or Find Out More.  Your contact details should be clearly visible, especially through whatever contact method you prefer.  You can put your complete contact details in the footer of your site and then use the clickable buttons in various positions on the various pages with your phone number or email address. 

Hopefully, this brief overview has helped you clarify some of the important elements you should incorporate into your small business website.  An attractive, articulate website that speaks authentically to the prospect and makes it clear what you'd like them to do will give you an edge over your competitors.
