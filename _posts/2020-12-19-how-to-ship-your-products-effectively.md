When starting your eCommerce business, it can be very daunting and you need to make sure you do it right so that you get the most out of it.  One of the most important aspects when it comes to running an eCommerce store is shipping.  A lot of effort is needed for customers to have a good experience throughout the whole buying process, and shipping is one of the most important parts. It allows the person who bought your product to finally experience your brand for themselves. That's why it's important to plan the entire shipping process and not cut corners. 

One of the most important things to do about shipping is planning a strategy.  With this plan, you can determine what you want to do and what to aim for.  Things like your prices and how to calculate what to charge are more.  When you sell through multiple sales channels, eCommerce shipping across multiple channels can be overwhelming.  Hence, you definitely need to have a strategy and plan for shipping your stores.

One of the first things to determine in your plan is shipping rates.  How will you do this?  With so many different messaging services and shipping options available, you can easily become overwhelmed and not know what to look for.  As a small business, you may not be able to afford shipping costs for all of your products, so you may need to charge your customers for it.  This is why you should always make sure that you find the most profitable courier services that also provide good service to make your customers happy. 

Once you have determined your shipping methods, you should know how to calculate your shipping rates.  All shipping couriers will base the shipping rates on many factors such as the size, weight, and distance of the package.  So you need to make sure that the courier service you want to go with is affordable for your business.  One of the most important factors in the shipping process is the packaging.

Packaging plays a big role because it is what the customer ultimately gets. It's part of representing your brands, so it needs to be done right.  For a small business, it can be very difficult to find good quality and also affordable packaging to buy, but you can always find some great deals and alternative packaging at affordable and on budget.  You should always think about how the packaging represents your brand, such as the color of the package and any brand such as the logos on it as well.

Overall, you need to make sure you are always aware of your shipping costs, as it plays an important role in your business.  You need to research and make sure you are as affordable as possible.  As mentioned above, if you sell on more than one sales channel, the shipping can be quite overwhelming but with multi-channel eCommerce listing software, you can easily take charge of the entire business from one place while easily keeping your inventory.
