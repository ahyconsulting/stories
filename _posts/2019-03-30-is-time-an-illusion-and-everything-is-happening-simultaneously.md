Recently I came across this bizarre yet convincing theory about time and its relativity to our memories.

#### What is Time?

Time feels real. Forward moving sequence of advancement. Time is like a river, always flowing, in order, one after another. We understand time as something which can be quantified between events and has duration. This means we can measure time.

#### Is Time not Real? Is it just an illusion?

What if time is not real? What if time is just an illusion and a projection of our mind trying to organise memories? <b>What if everything is happening simultaneously? </b> And our mind is constructing this reality of time just to make sense of what is NOW.

#### Baffled? There is more.

If space-time is like a DVD then life is like a Movie. DVD does not change despite all the drama and plots inside the movie. So if we go by the theory, then everything is happening now. Everything is happening simultaneously. Mind blown, right?

#### How do I process this?

It's a theory, and should be processed like one. If everything is happening simultaneously, then I am already a multi billionare, just waiting to happen on this dimension. Now has a different meaning altogether.

If there is a remote possibility of this being true, and physicists working on this are able to establish this as fact, just imagine the kind of impact it will make on the mindset.

#### Laws of Universe

A very wise person told me this, if everything is happening simultaneously, you already have what you want in life. The kind of impact this makes on your psyche is unimaginable.

If a palm reader tells a child that he is destined to be wealthy, his entire life he believes in this prediction. This strong belief will subconsciously help this child to take decisions to be rich and wealthy. <a href="https://stories.ahyconsulting.com/rich-vs-poor-mindset/">As the man thinks so is he and the words become flesh!</a>
