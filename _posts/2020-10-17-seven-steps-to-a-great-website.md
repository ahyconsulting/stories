Before you start work on the actual design of the site, you should have a clear idea of what message you want your design to communicate and what style of design you intend to use.


First, think about the impression you want your target audience to be left with when they visit your site. Should they think of you as "trustworthy", "young" or "high-tech"? Then look at other people's sites, as well as ads in magazines and newspapers, to find a style you think would work for you. Once you find a style you like, ask a few potential customers what they think. After all, they're the people who'll be using your site.


###  Mood Boards
An effective way to plan the appearance of your site is to create a mood board.  Find objects with a style, color, or shape that reflects how you want this site to look, for example, magazine ads and pieces of fabric, and then glue to a sheet of construction paper.  This will help you set a mood for the site when you are designing it, such as "dark and gothic" or "young and modern." 

A mood board will give you a good starting point for your site design and can help you communicate your ideas to other people.  It should also give you ideas for colors, images, and characters. 

### 7 Steps to a Great Site

### 1. Planning:

Before you start working on your website, you need to plan it meticulously.  Make sure to set a clear goal for your site, then use your knowledge of your target audience to find out how you will achieve it.

### 2. Design: 

The next step is to design your site in a graphics package, such as Photoshop. It is important to finalize the design before you start building your site, as it is much quicker and cheaper to make changes in Photoshop than in HTML. 

### 3. Writing and Content Gathering: 

During the planning phase, you should have decided which pages you want your site to contain. Now it's time to write the text and decide which images to use. You can often create the content at the same time as you design the website.

### 4. Building the Site: 

Once you know what the site will look like and what it will contain, you need to convert it to a real website.  You will use HTML and CSS to create web pages based on your Photoshop designs. You can also create a database. 

### 5. Testing: 

Does the site work?  Can people use it as intended?  Before launching your site, you should test it thoroughly.  Check for broken links and make sure the site works on different browsers.  Also, check for spelling mistakes.

### 6. Promotion:

Your site is finished, so you can now sit back and watch your visitors flock to - right?  not exactly!  Setting up your website there is just the beginning;  Now you need to get people to visit with search engines, marketing, and word of mouth.

### 7. Evolution: 

Once your site is done and visitors start coming in, you may think your work is done, but it's not. The best sites are constantly making small improvements and testing new ideas.
