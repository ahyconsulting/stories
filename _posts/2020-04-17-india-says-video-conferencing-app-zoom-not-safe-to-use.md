Many organisations use zoom on a regular basis, because how easy it is to use. But, the Cyber Coordination Centre (CyCord) of ministry of home affairs said in a new <a href="assets/pdf/comprehensive-advisory-Zoom-meeting-platfom-20200412.pdf" target="\_blank">16-page advisory</a> stating "**Zoom is a not a safe platform**". The government's warning comes after India's nodal cyber security agency â€“ Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-in) - had cautioned against the vulnerability of the app.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MHA issues advisory, says Zoom not secure video conferencing platform for private individuals. Mentions guidelines for those who still want to use it. <a href="https://t.co/b900JOw1Si">pic.twitter.com/b900JOw1Si</a></p>&mdash; Prasar Bharati News Services (@PBNS_India) <a href="https://twitter.com/PBNS_India/status/1250717092208431105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

While Germany and Taiwan has banned the use of app, renowned firms like Tesla, NASA and Google have also advised their employees against the use of the app.

The download and use of Zoom for video conferencing and meetings have increased exponentially after the lockdown. Several ministers had even tweeted pictures showing they were using zoom.

Zoom has released the recent version with many security updates, but the question remains, is it in safe waters yet?
