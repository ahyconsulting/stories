# Tips to make your website look professional

### 01. Keep it minimal

I have seen many of the people put a lot of elements in a homepage..like a new website owner wants to overdue their website with a lot of animations, transition effects, drop shadow, colors, etc. Like I mentioned in <a href="https://stories.ahyconsulting.com/simple-is-not-always-minimal/" target="\_blank">one of my blog post</a>

### 02. Always use high-quality images

we know that high-quality images will affect the speed of your website but they are a great way to make it stand out from the rest, always use compressed images it will reduce the image size without losing its quality. This will make your website look stunning as well as very professional. If you have a good budget instead of using stock images, hire a professional photographer.

### 03. Always use high-quality images

Use color scheme as per your business, like green color represents eco-friendly products. The color scheme can have a huge impact on brand image and the immediate appeal of your website. Just do not pick any random favorite color for your website. **(THIS IS JUST A NOO!)**

### 04. Use ample white space

As a designer, Iâ€™ve always believed that whitespace is the fundamental building block of good design. White space represents the space between images, texts, margins, graphics, columns, and other page elements.

### Why designers use white space on a website?

**a.** For better readability

**b.** It attracts the viewer attention

**c.** It sets the tone and hierarchy of your page.

### 05. Typography

Typography plays an important role in your design. Your website gives information about your business which is presented in a header and a paragraph form. When you choose the right kind of typeface for your text, you make the text a lot more presentable and readable to your readers.

### Conclusion

You can make your website look professional by following these tips and can attract the right audience, build a loyal following, and ultimately increase sales.
