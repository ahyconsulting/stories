While savings are one of the main reasons people prefer to shop online, these promotions make business sweeter for customers and can help drive more traffic and revenue.  Promotions are also one of the most effective ways to generate long-term loyalty to new visitors.  Here is a list of the top 4 
 
 
### 1. Free Shipping

One of the most common reasons for cart abandonment is the additional shipping fee.  A lot of customers just don't complete the purchase when they see the shipping fee added during the checkout process. Online shoppers love free shipping.  If you're looking for more traffic and sales, free site-wide shipping or a particular product category can be a great option.

### 2. Free Offers

Every online shopper loves getting things for free. You can consider an offer like “Buy this and get this for free” or something like “Spend ₹X and get this product for free”. This can be done when the sales of a particular product category are not up to the mark or when you want to encourage the customers to spend more.


### 3. Discounts

You can consider offering a percentage or quantity-based discount in your online store.  While percentage-based discounts can be considered by every type of e-commerce store, quantity discounts are generally preferred by stores that cater to merchants and distributors.  In addition to having a positive impact on your customers, such discounts are also a great way to beat your competitors.
 
 
From attracting new customers, moving existing stock, to hitting your sales target during the slow sales period, these discount offers can be helpful in multiple ways.  But before offering such discounts, make sure you first know the exact product margin, break-even point, and markup.  Keep discounts in such a way that you can still make a decent profit.  If you are new to the business, prefer to hire e-commerce SEO services to effectively implement this strategy.


### 4. Reward Points

Many online stores have had great success with loyalty programs where customers can earn reward points for their purchases. When customers see that they are receiving reward points for their purchase, your store will soon become the go-to option for them whenever they search for a product that you offer these points. 
You can offer them discounts based on the reward points they have and even offer bonus reward points for collecting a certain number of points.
