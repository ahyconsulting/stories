### What is a logo? 

A logo is a symbol made up of text, images, and shapes that identifies a business. A good logo shows what a company does and what the brand values. A logo can and should be more than a symbol of identification.


### Types of Logos are-

### Emblem

An emblem logo consists of font inside a symbol or an icon; think badges, seals, and crests. These logos incline to have a traditional appearance about them that can make a striking impact, thus they are often the go-to cull for many schools, organizations, or regime agencies.
 

### Abstract 
The term abstract in itself symbolizes what this type of logo conveys- a logo designed in impressive shape, normally based on a concept. In the first glance itself, the logo poses an ambiguity. These kinds of the logo are typically utilized by huge organizations, but very hard to design. These logos have less literal representation. These types of the logo can be chosen if you simply want an image without a text. 
With an abstract logo for a business, there will be instant brand recognition. Some great examples are- Nike, Playstation, Pepsi, Chase, to name a few. 
 
### Wordmark
 Any logo with the brand's name is a wordmark logo, with emphasis given on typography. These types of logos strengthen a brand's visual identity. With this aspect in mind, designing should be done by carefully creating the font style. Mostly the word meaning will be associated with the color, and font of the logo, including the case of a logo word with no special meaning. One extraordinary thing with word type is that the logo is simply the name, which implies there will be solid acknowledgment among the crowd.
Some prominent examples are Google, Sony, Facebook, Coca-cola, Canon, Yahoo, to name a few. Mostly wordmark logos are based on a particular signature, font, or handwriting. Because of its simplicity, a wordmark logo conveys history and confidence, if used by an established company. But it doesn't mean that wordmark is restricted to large companies, startups can also use it to help develop an identity. The effectiveness of a wordmark logo will be more if the brand has an out of the ordinary name.

### Letterform
A letter-shaped logo is distinctive with the wordmark due to its use of the brand name initials and is completely typographical.  Some notable examples are HBO, CNN, HP, NASA, to name a few.  In most cases, brands with difficulty pronouncing longer names or names choose a letter-shaped logo.  Furthermore, there is an added benefit of brand recognition in global markets.  Lettermark stands out for its simplicity.  It will be easier to call HP back than Hewlett-Packard.  One of the best examples of letter-shaped logos is the Rainbow Aluminium logo.
 
### Pictorial Mark
You may have noticed logos simply with an icon, picture, or even an icon.  Then you've seen a trademark or a figurative mark of a trademark.  Apple, WWF, Nike, Twitter, Dominos Pizza.  This type of logo creates a deeper connection with the audience because a text image is less remembered than an image.  A figurative mark is recognized immediately from everywhere.  As a result, new brands could have difficulties using this logo as they face tough competition from their counterparts.  When designing a logo, the image should be designed so that an average customer can associate the logo with the brand.  Most of the time, figurative marks are updated over time.

### Signature
 A signature is a combination of the wordmark, the tagline, and the symbol.  Oftentimes this logo contains a separate logo and branding, but some are not.  And if a particular company offers varied products and services, a logo will not be enough.
 
### Combination Mark
 The name indicates what the combination mark is.  It combines both a wordmark and a brand.  Sometimes when the mark becomes famous, they simply remove the word mark.  An example of a combination brand is Adidas, McDonald's, Burger King, to name a few.  The great advantage of a combined brand is that people can relate both the brand name and the image, and can easily remember the brand.
 
### Final Thoughts
 
One of the important things while designing a website is knowing whether or not the logo expresses your business properly. The designer, before designing, should thoroughly research to help him determine what works.
