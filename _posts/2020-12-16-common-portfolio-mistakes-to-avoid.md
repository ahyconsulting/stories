### 1 - UNDEFINED CASE STUDIES

Writing case studies might be the most dreaded part of building a design portfolio. But next to your About page, case studies are the most important part of your portfolio.

### 2 - TOO MUCH WORK

It's far stronger to have five quality projects showing five design pieces within it, than 20 average projects with 10+ design pieces within them.

### 3 - NO CLEAR CONTEXT.

Don't be shy about including clients in your portfolio design to attract new, potential clients. This will help launch your design career.

### 4 - CONTACT DETAILS ARE HARD TO FIND.

What's the best way to contact you â€” and can your potential new art director or boss find it?

### 5 - IT'S NOT MOBILE FRIENDLY

These days, it's increasingly likely that potential clients will be viewing your portfolio site on mobile devices. So you need to make sure it's not going to look awful on a small screen.

### PORTFOLIO CHECKLIST

- Include defined case studies
- Quality over quantity
- Clear context
- Easy Contact option
- Mobile-friendly website

### HERE ARE FIVE MAIN THINGS TO INCLUDE

01. Name the client for whom you work for.
02. Mention if it's a personal or agency project.
03. Include the challenges you faced.
04. Specify your role.
05. How you helped the client to achieve.
