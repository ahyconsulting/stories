I have studied in both Kendriya Vidyalaya and a Convent private school.

While I was in KV, everyone was encouraged to participate in sports and cultural functions. Every single student was given a chance and motivation to speak in public.

Unfortunately this was not the case in my other school. We were not allowed to speak or put up our opinions. Students were not given any opportunity to speak or perform in front of masses.

Before joining this school I was a confident boy and ended up graduating as a shy person with stage fright.

It took me years to overcome these challenges and fear.

Studies are important, but I use my interpersonal skills far far more than I use my grades to leave a positive and honest impression.

Focus on building your individuality.
