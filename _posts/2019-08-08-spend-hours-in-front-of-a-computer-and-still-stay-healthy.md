Before we jump into providing tips, let’s pause for a minute and discuss "working at a computer for a long period".

Working eight hours a day (or more!) with minimal movement just isn’t healthy. It isn’t! It leads to symptoms like back and eye pain, muscle twitching, and (in the long-term), can lead to severe health issues. In this fast-paced, modern life, many people struggle to keep their health at an optimal level while working 8 plus hours a day. So, to make this struggle a bit easier, we are going to name all the ways you can stay healthy if you work at a computer at least 8-10 hours a day.


The first thing you need to know is that if you are experiencing some health issues caused by spending too much time sitting at a desk, you are not the only one. The second thing you need to know is that the lack of movement can do some severe damage to your overall health.

Research shows that sitting for long periods of time leads to high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol levels and obesity. This means you are unconsciously raising your chances of getting a cardiovascular disease or even cancer in the long term.


In addition to physical problems, sitting at a desk for a third of a day can lead to psychological issues. Spending too much time in front of a screen leads to social anxiety, as a result of not spending enough time with your loved ones. This type of anxiety often causes insomnia, which then leads to even more stress.

As you can see, sitting for 8 plus hours per day does some serious harm to your whole body. But, fear not. Now you know that back pain is one of the least distressing symptoms you can experience, we are sure you are ready to do something about it and change your mindset. Here then, are some tips on how to stay healthy if you work at a computer all day:

### 1 - Take a Morning Walk

One of the best tips we can give you to stay healthy if you work at a computer all day is to do some morning walk.

How are you going to make sure you do the walk? It’s pretty simple, actually. Park a block away from your office instead of utilizing company parking. If you are taking a bus, get off a couple stops before you would typically do so. Practice these tips, and your body will feel more energized and awake after a week or so.
It takes about 30 days for a body to adjust and adapt to new habits, so after only a month, you will start to feel better and less tired.

### 2- Have a cup of morning coffee

There is no doubt that drinking coffee comes with a lot of benefits. Thanks to the fact that it is high in antioxidants, it lowers the risk of getting liver disease and prevents type 2 diabetes. We can honestly mention coffee as one of the best and most delicious beverages out there. This beverage has a tendency to disrupt sleep, especially if you drink it in the afternoon. Not to mention, drinking too much coffee can cause anxiety, and in some cases, panic attacks.

In the end, should you drink coffee? Well, the answer is, yes. But, do it in moderation. One cup of coffee in the morning to wake and freshen you up is more than enough, and will help you stay healthy while working.

### 3 - Blink more often

Staring at a screen for an extended period of time can change the structure of your tears and no wonder your eyes hurt! Research says people who spent 8 hours behind the desk had lower levels of mucin 5AC, a protein credited for tear stickiness and an even spread across the eye. The good news is that this “damage” is not permanent, and your protein level rises as soon as your eyes are well-rested.

So, to make sure your eyes stay healthy if you work at a computer, all you need to do is blink more often and take 5-minute breaks every 15 minutes or so. Not only will your eye muscle relax, but you will also feel more awake and productive after the break.

### 4 - Keep your gut healthy



The one aspect you most definitely need to pay attention to in order to stay healthy if you work at a computer all day is to take into account what you put in your body.

Why does it matter so much what diet you are following?

Since your health is connected to (and if we may even say dependent on) the bacteria that is in your gut. More precisely, there are up to 500 groups of bacteria that are credited for the health of your body. When the bacteria balance gets disturbed, that’s when your metabolism is not operating at an optimal level, and you start to get sick. Some of the most common diseases that can occur when microbiota is not maintained are diabetes, high blood sugar, obesity, heart disease, and, in some cases, cancer. That is why it is essential for you to take care of your gut. You can only do it by following a healthy diet plan.

So, what we would suggest is to be prepared when hunger takes over. Eating healthy snacks doesn’t mean you should eat tasteless food that won’t keep you full. Just the opposite – you are going to eat some delicious meals that will prepare your stomach for dinner time.

We would suggest you opt for citrus fruits and nuts. This is by far the most popular healthy work snack. However, if you need something to raise your blood sugar level, apples and peanut butter can help.

### 5 - Keep yourself hydrated



The clear, tasteless liquid is so beneficial and helps you stay healthy if you work at a computer all day.

Your body consists of 60% water. Additionally, your blood is 90% water, which is why there are so many benefits to drinking water. However, we are only interested in these three:

+ keeping the brain healthy
+ delivering oxygen throughout your body
+ keeping your digestive system healthy


Not drinking enough water can change your brain structure and, therefore, have an impact on thinking and how well you are able to concentrate. So, if you are having difficulty concentrating at work, be sure to ask yourself whether you have drunk enough water that day.

Your blood is responsible for transferring oxygen throughout the body. Because the blood consists of 90% water, drinking enough water can only improve the blood flow.

The last benefit we mentioned is connected to the previously mentioned tip – having a healthy gut. Keeping your digestive system is imperative if you want to maintain your overall health. Not to mention, water can flush all the gut toxins out.

### 6 - Keep a Hand Sanitizer

Keeping your hands and desk clean is one of the most significant factors to consider to stay healthy if you work at a computer all day. How so?

Well, think about it. After you drove (or walked) to work, your hands, undoubtedly, got dirty. The next thing you do is to sit at a desk and use your computer. Those bacteria you picked up on your way to work will end up all over your keyboard, mouse, even monitor. The real danger occurs when all that disgusting bacteria builds up over time forming a microbe-friendly environment.

To stop this from happening, be sure to sanitize your hands before you sit down at your desk.
