It's not an easy step of dropping your money in the Investment zone but at the same time, it is a key step to build your future corpus.

### The golden rules that can be used in investment -

1. The most important rule of money investment is that whatever money we are investing in, it should be safe. We should adopt an investment method that protects your principal and at the same time provide good returns. Therefore invest thoughtfully in a place where the money you have invested is safe.

2. You have to invest your money in such a way that you can get high returns. For this, financial education is most important. Without this, it will be like “shooting in the air” in the world of investment. With Financial Education, you can know the right way to invest, where to invest, how long to invest, and why. Everything will be clear to you in advance and you will be successful.

3. One rule of investing money is that wherever you invest your money, you do not have to do any work for returns there. Here money works itself and brings more money for you. This golden rule of investment says that you should never work for money, rather money should work for you. If you make such an investment, then nothing can stop you from becoming rich.

4. You need to invest your money in such a way where there is low risk and high return. There is a saying by most people “lower the risk, the lower the return, and the higher the risk, the higher the return”. While it is not so, if you invest your money by doing research, then you can get high returns easily even at low risk.

5. While investing money, keep in mind that do not invest all your money in one place, rather invest a little money in many places so that the risk of losing money can be greatly reduced. Diversification of money is very important while investing. Without Diversification, your money either goes to high risk or returns are very less.

6. While doing money investment, it is very good that you are doing Diversification of your money but only Diversify money will not work. You have to check from time to time whether good returns are coming from wherever you have invested. If you are not getting good returns from somewhere, then remove money from there and invest in the place where good returns are being received.

7. Money Investment is like a tap from which water (returns) comes to you continuously without doing any work. Keeping this in mind, you should understand the difference between Assets and Liability. You buy those things or invest in these things, with which the price will increase with time or it will continue to give very good returns every month or year.

8. Now another golden rule of investing money is that you invest your money in a place where you can get very good returns and also open many ways to invest.

9. Everyone has many dreams and thinks that he can use many Luxuries but most people are not able to do so. But those who know how to make good investments can also enjoy luxuries.

10. For this, you do some of your investments so that you can buy and enjoy luxury from the returns that you get. Keep in mind you have to take Luxuries not from your own money, but the money earned.

One thing you need to keep in mind is that you can only manage your investment effectively. If you manage your investments with another person, you will either get cheated or you may not get good returns. You can take advice from any good expert, but manage your money yourself.
