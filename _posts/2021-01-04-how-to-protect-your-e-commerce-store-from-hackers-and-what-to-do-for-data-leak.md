After the pandemic hit the world, a lot of businesses entered online, and the e-commerce industry has boomed due to home shopping.  Building an e-commerce website can be easy, but even more difficult is keeping it secure. 

Hackers target e-commerce sites because they store their customers' financial and personal information. Ensuring security on e-commerce sites is becoming crucial as cyber-attacks increase. 

A single data breach can reveal tons of important personal and financial information, leading to a loss of reputation and potentially the end of the business.  If you want to maintain your company's reputation and customer base, you need to implement high-end security measures.  Don't let hackers have the opportunity to attack a website without security.  You can use the following security measures to fully protect your e-commerce business.

Hackers find it difficult to buy a security if you add SSL certification to your site.  With it, you can protect and gain the trust of customers.

### 05. If there is an older database, delete them

According to PCI standards, an e-commerce site is never allowed to store customer information on servers such as credit card numbers, personal information, expiration dates, etc.  Most e-commerce platforms allow you to delete the old data store in your database server.  Storing such data for too long can allow hackers to steal sensitive information.

So if you want to protect important information, you have to delete old customer records from cookies or servers.

### 06. Always follow PCI regulations

The non-compliant companies are the ones that cannot protect your stored data, so if you don't want to put your business data at risk and face legal charges, you must follow PCI regulations.
