Working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic continues as there's no sudden stop to it. Moreover, businesses are taking this as an opportunity to improve their strategies to make remote working a hassle less effort/procedure for employees.

Businesses need to ensure that employees' productivity is not compromised by adopting new ways to communicate with each other.

Below are three easy ways to adapt communication styles to ensure remote teams are working efficiently and effectively as you were in the office.

### 1. Define communication channels for better engagement

Businesses can implement enterprise communication solutions like Oneteam by Scalefusion to create channels that are 
* Closed(Only selected members can be in the group), 
* Open(Anyone in the organization can join the group), 
* Limited-Public(Only limited public can access the group)

### 2. Organize daily sync-ups

Daily team sync-up is necessary to know how your employees are doing remotely, it's good to have a human touch by asking about them and their schedule rather than just about work

### 3. Respect the time-zones

If you happen to have teams working at different time zones, keep in mind about their working hours, it's not necessary that they may operate in the same manner when things were normal.
