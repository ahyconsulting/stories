Selecting the right e-commerce platform is vital for the success of your brand. It would help if you were careful while choosing as those platforms will be responsible for your brand to grow or change. 

Firstly, you need to analyze which e-commerce platform is ideal for your brand as not all of them focus on the same thing.

After listing your priorities, you can look at the given below e-commerce platforms that might boost your sales.

### 1. WooCommerce

WooCommerce is ideal for those brands that need a customizable platform, know WordPress well, and have coding chops. It is a platform that has high customizability, built-in analytics, and 24/7 customer support. However, it doesn’t allow proper SEO and social media marketing.

### 2. Shopify

Shopify is extremely popular in the world of e-commerce marketing. It is the platform for those who rely on social media marketing to sell or who do drop shipping. It is simple, flexible, and scalable for small and medium-sized brands. As Shopify focuses on marketing and gives customer experience management, it struggles to handle the most significant brands.

### 3. Big Commerce 

Unlike Shopify, BigCommerce can handle large brands and with better SEO performance. It has a one-page checkout experience that can boost your conversion rate, but it fails to give the one-click upsells that Shopify does. But if you go for BigCommerce, you can get high customizability and constant customer support.


### 4. OpenCart

If you find BigCommerce expensive, you can go for OpenCart. It’s open-source and free-to-use, but you can invest in add-ons costing from free to $100. It would help if you had a strong coding ability to use its high customizability as their support isn’t as strong as others.


### 5. Squarespace

Squarespace is used by small brands, who don’t need much coding skills. It is an appealing platform with excellent design from a simple drag-and-drag interface based on several beautiful templates. But it is not ideal for you if you want high sales or focus on e-commerce.


### 6. Magento

Magento, by Adobe, is especially prevalent in Asia. Now, North American companies have started to acknowledge the power behind this platform. Magento eCommerce development is an ideal platform for small or large brands that can handle a more complicated interface than Squarespace
