It seems that we all want a few extra hours a week to get through everything we
want to. When was the last time you found yourself saying that you’ll do something
when you find time for it? Everyone agrees that time is something we all want more
of; more time to get through all our work, more time to be with friends and family,
and more time to relax. However, how often do you find yourself rushing around like
a headless chicken desperately trying to get everything done? or feeling frustrated
and bordering on the rage because you just simply don’t have the time you want?
<strong>Feeling stressed and overwhelmed constantly</strong> is not fun at all, so why is change so hard? 

We live in a world where we want instant solutions and gratification, but for a price,
of course, and the least amount of effort on our part. When we need something to
be fixed or changed, it’s easy to go and buy a solution, but what about those
problems that aren’t so tangible, like time? Of course, those who master their time
have developed skills and learned techniques, but they all share something else
which is the root of their success—a mindset that enables them to manage their
time effortlessly. Improving the way, you manage your time starts with the way you
view time, your perspective.

###  Getting Organized

Everyone has the same 24 hours in their day, yet it’s obvious that many people
achieve more in a few months than most people do in years. Why is that? I have
heard so many different excuses, and among my favorite are definitely <strong>“I was born
this way, I’ve always been disorganized </strong>“? I didn’t know there was a gene for
disorganization. Another is, “it will <strong>make me less creative and restrict my freedom</strong>
“—on the contrary, being organized frees your mind up to be more creative!

If you think that you don’t have time to do anything, you will most probably find that
you don’t. If you think that you are unable to take control of the reins and manage
your time, that is what your experience will be. Your external world reflects your
internal world, your thinking. If you are disorganized on the outside, you most likely
feel disorganized on the inside, which is why you need to start with mastering your
mindset. We cannot buy or create more time, but we can make more time by
creating a time management mindset.

### Tips to Get You Started:

1. <strong>The Blame Game:</strong> Stop blaming others for your results; you are
responsible for how you spend your time and what you achieve with it—it’s
that simple. It’s easy to blame others for not being able to accomplish what
you needed to, but you have to take responsibility.

2. <strong>Self-Sabotage:</strong> Stop telling yourself that you won’t get things finished on
time, or you won’t be able to find time to do something. Those who manage
their time successfully never set themselves up negatively, because that is
what you are doing by affirming before you have even started that it will turn
out badly and not work out. Remember that what you expect, you get! Catch
yourself from limiting phrases like this, and be more positive. You will feel
more empowered and in control by affirming to yourself that it will work out
well, and your actions will be directed accordingly.

3. <strong>Think:</strong> This might seem like a strange tip, but I’m not referring to your daily
thoughts—I am referring to the way you think habitually. What normally
happens when you have to plan your day ahead of time or rearrange your
schedule? Develop the habit of always looking for opportunities to leverage
your time, prioritizing your actions in your mind, and knowing the best way
to focus your actions. The way you plan your days and perform your tasks
are directly related to your thinking, so if you are not seeing the results you
want, change the way you think in that area.

You can learn all the techniques and tools in the book, but if you don’t believe that it
will help or your negative thoughts keep you struggling with time, you won’t ever
really master your time—until you master your mindset.
