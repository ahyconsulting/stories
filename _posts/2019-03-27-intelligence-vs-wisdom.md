There's a huge difference between intelligence and wisdom. And that difference is called perspective.

Intelligence boils down to curiosity and wisdom boils down to patience.

Intelligence will help you find right answers and wisdom helps you to find right questions.

Overuse of one attribute can wear you out while the other one can calm you down.

Both are needed in the right mix. Nurture accordingly.
