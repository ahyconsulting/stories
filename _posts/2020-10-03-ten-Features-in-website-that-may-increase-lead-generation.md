It's often noticed that landing pages get more attention in the lead generation process.  But thank-you pages a visitor does not get overlooked once they submit a form on a landing page and turn it into a lead. Along with the thank you page, be sure to add a link for a new potential customer to download the offer. You can also include social media sharing buttons to generate additional leads.
 
### 9. Subscribe to a newsletter- 

This plays an important role in the lead generation process as once a user enters their email ID, you can submit your daily blogs with the registered email address and this increases your chances of conversion which leads to a potential customer.

Remember, no lead is magically converted. Only your efforts are important for the conversion. Lead nurturing should start with regularly following up on emails that have great content. As you maintain them, learn from your recent emails, keep in touch regularly, and send any future offers accordingly.
