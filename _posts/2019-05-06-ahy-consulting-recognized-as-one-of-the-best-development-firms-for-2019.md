At Ahy, we are building and maintaining skills to tackle any issues and provide solutions with faster implementations. Our primary objective is to understand business goals, prepare for <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce" target="\_blank">future advancements</a>, and align our team to focus on these priorities.

We are proud to announce we are featured in Clutch’s report, featuring the top B2B companies in India, specifically for the development category.

Clutch ranks and evaluates firms based on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria. One is expertise. Ahy Consulting continues to raise the bar in the development field, particularly among the leading <a href="https://clutch.co/in/developers/ecommerce" target="\_blank">Ecommerce development companies</a> on Clutch’s platform. Clutch is a ratings and reviews research firm for companies that provide marketing, development, and general digital services & solutions. They are based in Washington D.C. and conduct reviews for clients of the companies on their site.

Our recognition stems from our superior reputation in the industry and consistent dedication to serving our client’s needs. Here are a few notable excerpts from our Clutch reviews (and thank you again to our clients for your support and kind word!):

>“They put the client’s goals front and center and tailor their approach to find the best solution.”

Our reviews have also led to our inclusion on The Manifest as one of the <a href="https://themanifest.com/in/ecommerce-development/companies#ahyconsulting" target="\_blank">top ecommerce developers</a> in India. The Manifest is similar to Clutch in that it is another online database that researches top global B2B providers.

Ahy Consulting was also featured on Visual Objects, Clutch’s newest sister website, which provides buyers with a centralized catalog of the work leading B2B companies from around the world have delivered to their clients. On this platform, the <a href="https://visualobjects.com/user-experience/top-ux-designers" target="\_blank">top top UX designers</a> are featured alongside visual displays of their impressive work.

We’re grateful to be featured so prominently on multiple technology directories. We may have made this annual list, but our clients are the real stars. A special thank you to Clutch for this recognition and to our wonderful clients for choosing to work with <a href="https://clutch.co/profile/ahy-consulting" target="\_blank">Ahy Consulting</a>!
