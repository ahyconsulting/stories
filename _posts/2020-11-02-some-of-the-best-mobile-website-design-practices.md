### Use a font size large enough to read text on a small screen. 

Mobile phone screen size is limited, so font size is very important.  Using the correct size helps achieve good readability throughout the system.  Generally, the rule of thumb is that font size should be 16px for mobile sites. 

### Optimize and Minimize the file size. 

Use websites like TinyJPG or Photoshop's "Export for Web" feature to minimize the file size of your images before uploading them to your website.  Considering the bandwidth is very important for mobile devices as large files require more bandwidth to support Experience. 

### Keep important elements of the website within reach.

According to a study by mobile UX expert Steve Hoober, 75 percent of people use one thumb for interaction.  Organize content in a way that puts primary interactions front and center, providing secondary and tertiary functions for the top and bottom edges of the screen.

### Use a single column to display information instead of using a table with multiple columns. 

This will make the content more optimized. For example, use collapsible content sections also known as accordions to make the column shorter and easily accessible contents.

### Don't forget to link Phone Numbers and Emails

This makes a huge difference in the conversion rate. Think of the struggle of trying to copy the number, pasting it elsewhere, and also accidentally copying all the rest of the content on the page. Just use the HTML when displaying the number this way and it will be clickable.
