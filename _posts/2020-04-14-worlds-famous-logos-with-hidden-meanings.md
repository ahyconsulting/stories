### Fedex

FedEx is one of my favorite logos. When you see the logo closely try to focus on E and X letters (orange color). In the white space, there is an arrow that represents speed and precision.


### Amazon

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/amazon.png" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

A decorative yellow arrow underneath a logo that starts from A and ends at z. It represents that this company sells everything from A to Z. The arrow also represents the smile that customers would experience when shopping with the company.


### Apple

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/apple.jpg" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

Rob Yanov, the designer who created with the world-famous Apple company logo, has explained how he came up with the idea: ’I bought a whole bag of apples, placed them in a bowl, and spent time drawing them for a week, trying to break the image down into something simple. Taking a bite out of an apple was part of the experiment, and completely by coincidence I realized that ’bite’ sounded exactly the same as the computer term ’byte’.


### Baskin Robbins

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/Baskin-Robbins_logo.png" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

Baskin Robbins has two letters B And R. But the parts of the B and the R that are pink look like the number 31, which stands for the ice-cream chain's famous 31 flavors.


### NBC

<p class="mb-5"><img class="shadow-lg" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/2020/04/nbc.png" alt="{{ site.title }}" /></p>

The peacock in the NBC logo stands for color and pride.

Conclusion: Every logo should have meaning. Without any meaning, there is no use of the logo. A logo is a combination of text and visual imagery that serves two purposes. It tells people the name of the company and it creates a visual symbol that represents your business.
