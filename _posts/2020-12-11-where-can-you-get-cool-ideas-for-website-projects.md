### 1) Look at existing sites!

Get inspired and make a similar project, but put your own spin on it :

### Examples 

- TripAdvisor (travel and booking site) 
- Retail website with store locator 
- Restaurant website with online ordering

### 2) Solve problems in your own life

If there is something in your daily life that frustrates you and makes you think, "This should work better !!"  Then I found a potential idea for a project!  Identifying problems and being able to build a solution to them, even for a small thing, can be the start of many projects. 

### 3) What are your favorite websites or apps?

When you use a website or mobile app during the day, think about the features that make it work, write down the interesting ones, and you'll soon have a nice bank of ideas for the web apps you could create. 

### 4) Stay creative, and make unique projects.

Try to create ideas that are not very common in the tutorials, such as a weather app, Pomodoro timer, or a Trello clone.  Those are perfectly good ideas, but now they are a bit overused.

Your portfolio will stand out if you build unique projects that few other people have thought of.
