Your eCommerce store ought to operate well 24/7. solely during this case your client feels confidence, trusts you, and thirstily comes searching once more and once more. If some buttons don't work, the bound page shows a 404 error, or online support doesn’t react in operating hours…will your consumer have enough patience to return?
