There are a number of factors that influence the success of a website.  Website hosting is one of the key players.  Therefore, deciding on a web host requires careful planning for the best performance.  A bad selection will affect the performance of your website and flow into your business.  A quality web host plays a vital role in the overall performance of your website.  You should look for the best website hosting service that suits the specific requirements of your business. 
 
While every website is different and has different needs, there are a number of common criteria that every web host should provide that you should look for.  These criteria include reliability, availability, bandwidth, storage, scalability, pricing, and customer support.  All of these things should be taken into account before making any decisions about web hosting because the future of your website and business depends on a good, user-friendly website.  Here is a list of some reasons why good website hosting is important and how to choose it:
 
### Dependability:

If your business relies on your website to generate leads, then it is imperative that your website be online at all times.  If the web hosting server crashes, your website will not be accessible.  An offline website can cost you money and add to losses.  The best way to avoid this situation is to choose a web hosting service provider with high uptime.  
 
Many web hosting servers have downtime. This downtime is because of occasional updates and maintenance of servers. No web hosting service provider can offer you 100% uptime but it is necessary to choose one with the lowest possible downtime. 
 
In addition to the website loading speed, there is another important factor.  Lower SEO rankings and bounce rates depend on fast load times.  A reliable web host should provide the fastest possible load speeds. 

### Security of Data and Website:

Smooth website security is critical to businesses.  It is even more important for websites that handle payment details and other personal data of their users.  We have all heard of the breaches and violations on various sites.  Therefore, it is important for website owners to choose web hosting providers that offer seamless security features on their website.  
 
You can choose multiple packages from web hosting service providers that come with a variety of security features.  It is important to choose packages and web hosting with advanced security features.  A good web hosting service will offer additional security features and ensure that the security of your website and critical data is always in safe hands. 


### Scalability: 

A successful company requires well-thought-out and sustainable planning for the future.  A good web provider offers scalable solutions for your business to grow.  Occasionally you may notice a significant increase in traffic to your website or an increase in sales.  All of a sudden, you may need to upgrade your hosting service package or features. 
 
Your website may require additional server capacity to handle the increased traffic.  A good web host would offer you a managed plan with more scalability options in the future.  This would help your business grow and evolve over time.
