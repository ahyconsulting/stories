In this ongoing battle against the coronavirus, there is a glimmer of hope for travel lovers who can travel safely and responsibly. Governments are slowly easing travel restrictions, but with tough measures. Tour operators and hotels work with care and adhere to health warnings.

But for that group of travelers who have to travel because they have no other choice, here are 7 safety tips for traveling during the pandemic: 
 
### Get Yourself Tested:

Getting tested for COVID is the first thing that should be on the list of travel safety tips during the pandemic. Go to a COVID-19 testing center and start packing the bag only when the results are negative.
 
### Travel wisely:

Traveling means communicating with strangers by some means. Sharing seats and travel space is the first potential risk.  Hence, it is necessary to choose a safe method of travel, and travel experts say that airlines are the safest method of travel because they pose the minimum risk of being virus carriers.  The HEPA filtration system does wonders in keeping the air clean and virus free.  However, no one can guarantee that the stranger who shares the seat cannot be the carrier! 

Driving can be a safe option to eliminate potential hazards from strangers.  Pack all essentials, stock up on fuel, place a camping tent and gallons of drinking water on the roof rack and prepare to go on a safe trip.  For other travel, choose a window seat.  It is the best option to escape the threat of indoor virus contamination. 

### Be strict with social distancing:

Social distancing is the safest precaution to mitigate the risk of exposing yourself to the coronavirus.  The less interaction with strangers, the safer.  Remember not to shake hands and not to make physical contact, politely move away from people who do not wear masks.  Be doubly aware when sharing pools, gas bunks, shops and markets, bathrooms, dining rooms, and common areas. Masks can prevent many dangers that could occur from touching your mouth and nose. Invest in a good pair of gloves and get used to it. A mask and gloves can protect against risky contact surfaces such as taxi handles, lift buttons, ATM knobs, doors, windows, bill counters, POS buttons, etc. 

### Wash hands sanitize, repeat:

Washing hands thoroughly is the new normal.  At the earliest, get used to it and put it into practice.  Rinse hands and wash hands thoroughly with a rich lather and dry.  Repeat this as often as possible during the trip.  Increase the amount of high-quality disinfectant in the backpack.  Always carry a handy bottle in a pocket or purse.  Disinfect hands before and after touching.  Also make a habit of cleaning handbags, wallets, glasses, watches, cell phones, chargers, and headsets frequently. 

### Stay connected with friends and family:

Whether traveling alone for business or on an adventure trip with friends, be sure to stay in contact with parents and family.  Inform them at each stage of the trip and let them know your well-being.  Share the details of the day: who you met, what you ate, and where you stay.  Sharing intrinsic details with family and informing them of location and activities can help in times of need. Emergency contact information also serves as a savior when it comes to foreign land rules as they are rapidly changing due to the ongoing pandemic. 
 
### Gather knowledge about health safety:

Travel rules differ from state to state.  Gather comprehensive information about local state rules and the destination.  Equipped with all the necessary documents.  Be sure to have health insurance and identification documents, even if you are going by car.  Store disinfectant wipes as well as regular medications if needed. Contact the doctor by phone or video call if you suspect any change in your condition.  You may also need to notify local authorities and hotel owners if you find anything suspicious regarding your well-being.




### Maintain immunity levels:

Good immunity is the key to fighting infection. Focusing on diet, water, and exercise are important, especially for maintaining immunity amid this pandemic. Eat freshly cooked food, and avoid all kinds of raw foods.  Preferably a vegetarian. Eat soups, fresh fruits, and foods prepared by grilling with less oil. Continue to take a multivitamin, if any of this habit is involved.
