### MORE THAN JUST A PRETTY INTERFACE

Strategic web design involves identifying goals & using them to guide each & every aspect of the design

### RESEARCH, RESEARCH, RESEARCH

Developing a strategy starts with extensive research of the industry, competition, target audience, & of course the business itself

### GETTING INSIDE THEIR HEAD

Figuring out how the buyer will likely go through the decision-making process & creating a design that guides them through awareness, interest, consideration, & decision.

### JACK OF ALL TRADES

It requires a combination of analytical & intuitive thinking. It's a mix of art, psychology, research, marketing, problem-solving, business & more.

### THERE’S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING

The color of a button, the placement of an element, the font choice... every aspect has a reason leading to a specific goal
