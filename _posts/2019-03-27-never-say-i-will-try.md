A phrase which can almost immediately destroy your credibility is "I will try".

A person who says "I will try..." has accepted failure and can use it as an excuse or getaway.

A person who hears "I will try..." is left with doubt and chance of success. What probability? No clear answer. Leading to unreliability.

I respect the emotion behind "I will try..." but this does not give any clear action plan, you cannot gauge risk or draw metrics.

Let's try using this in some situations and you may let me know how you feel about it.

"I will try to pay salaries on time to my team."

"I will try to promote you in your next appraisal."

"I will try to attend your wedding."

"I will try to finish the presentation before our meeting."

"I will try to provide a good education for my child."

"I will try to attend my daughter's first interschool singing performance."

Do.. or Do not. There is no try
